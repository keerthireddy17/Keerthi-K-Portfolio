Hello, I’m Keerthi Reddy K!

I am a Data Engineer with over 4+ years of experience in business intelligence, data analytics, and engineering. My journey began with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from CBIT, where I developed a strong foundation in programming and project management. This foundation was further strengthened by my M.S. in Business Analytics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I delved deep into big data analytics, data science, and business intelligence.

In my professional experience, I’ve excelled in roles that required not just technical proficiency but also analytical thinking. As a Programmer Analyst, I’ve consolidated risk data across departments, designed interactive dashboards, and conducted in-depth market research, directly contributing to business decisions and performance improvements. My technical toolkit includes SQL, Python, PySpark, Apache Kafka, Apache Kudu, Tableau, Power BI, and a variety of big data and cloud tools. I’ve successfully migrated terabytes of data, optimized complex data pipelines, and developed utilities that significantly reduced manual errors.

I’m driven by the challenge of uncovering the stories hidden within data and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. Whether I’m optimizing a data pipeline, designing a predictive model, or exploring new cloud technologies, I’m always eager to push the boundaries of what data can do.

If you’re looking for a Data Engineer with a unique blend of business intelligence and data engineering skills, I’d love to connect.

Let’s explore how I can contribute to your next data-driven project.


<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Why Data Engineering and Beyond?</h3>

My journey into the world of data truly began during my time at CTS. Working on large-scale data projects, I was amazed by the power and potential of data to drive decisions, uncover insights, and solve complex problems. This experience sparked my passion for Data Engineering, as I saw firsthand how data could be transformed into a valuable asset. My fascination with data grew as I learned to build and optimize data pipelines, manage vast datasets, and use advanced tools to ensure seamless data flow across systems. This realization led me to fully embrace Data Engineering as my career path.

Explore this selection of projects that highlight my expertise in data engineering and data science. Each project demonstrates my ability to harness data, address real-world challenges, and deliver actionable insights.

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">1. Data Science using Python</h3>

<strong>Repo</strong> : <a href="https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository">https://github.com/keerthireddy17/Data-Science-Projects</a>

<strong>Housing Price Prediction</strong>

<strong>Description:</strong>

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using a detailed machine learning approach. Key tasks include improving data quality through preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling missing values. The project employs Linear Regression for prediction, applies log transformations to stabilize variance, and uses the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to address multicollinearity. Visualizations in Tableau complement the analysis, providing actionable insights.

<strong>Objective:</strong>

To develop a robust regression model that accurately predicts median California home prices based on factors such as location, housing attributes, economic indicators, and demographics. Evaluate the model's performance with statistical metrics and visualizations.

<strong>Skills:</strong>

- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression analysis, model evaluation, data visualization

<strong>Technology:</strong>

Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn

<strong>Results:</strong>

The regression model achieved a high R-squared value, indicating strong performance in predicting median housing prices. Key findings include a moderate positive correlation between median income and housing prices (0.69), suggesting higher incomes lead to more expensive homes. Housing characteristics such as median age and total rooms show weak positive correlations with prices, while location features like latitude and longitude exhibit weak negative correlations. Population density also has a weak negative correlation with housing prices. These results highlight the significance of socioeconomic and geographic factors in determining home prices.

<strong>FBI DataAnalysis-Data Cleaning</strong>

<strong>Description:</strong>

This project involved cleaning and preparing data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset included various crime statistics across different regions and years, providing a rich source of information for analysis. My role was to clean and preprocess this data to ensure its accuracy and usability for further analysis.

<strong>Goal:</strong>

The primary goal of this project was to transform raw, uncleaned data into a structured and reliable format. This included handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity. The cleaned dataset aimed to facilitate accurate and insightful analysis for crime trend evaluation and policy making.

<strong>Skills:</strong>

- Data Cleaning: Managed missing data, corrected inconsistencies, and standardized formats.
- Data Transformation: Converted data types, merged datasets, and created new features to enhance analysis.
- Tools and Technologies: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and Jupyter Notebooks for documentation and analysis.

<strong>Results:</strong>

- Successfully cleaned and transformed the dataset, reducing the error rate and improving data quality.
- Enhanced dataset usability for subsequent analytical tasks, including trend analysis and predictive modeling.
- Documented the data cleaning process, providing a clear and reproducible methodology for future work.

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">2. SQL -Structured Query Language</h3>

<strong>Repo</strong> : <a href="https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository">https://github.com/keerthireddy17/SQLPortfolio</a>

<strong>Analysis of Debt Statistics</strong>

<strong>Description:</strong>

This project involves analyzing international debt data provided by The World Bank. The dataset includes detailed information on the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories. The goal is to uncover insights into global debt patterns and their implications for economic management.

<strong>Goal:</strong>

- Examine and interpret debt statistics across different developing countries.
- Identify trends and correlations in debt data.

<strong>Analysis of Unicorn Companies</strong>

<strong>Description:</strong>

In this project, I analyzed data on unicorn companies (private startups valued at over $1 billion) to identify trends and patterns in high-growth industries. The objective was to support an investment firm in understanding which sectors are producing the highest valuations and the emergence rate of new unicorns.

<strong>Goal:</strong>

- Analyze valuation trends and emerging industries within the unicorn market.
- Determine which industries are experiencing the fastest growth.
- Provide strategic insights for investment decisions and portfolio structuring.
